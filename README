bcuz: bandcamp unzip

When you download stuff from bandcamp, it gives you a zip file that
extracts files into the current directory. This is a quick hack tries
to parse the filename as "artist - album", unpack the contents to
"artist/album/*", and remove the zip file (which can be kept with
-k). Works on my machineâ„¢, good enough for me.
